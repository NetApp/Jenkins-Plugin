# NetApp Jenkins Framework

The NetApp-Jenkins integration is an end-to-end framework from creating code repository until zipping the successful builds in the artifactory location. All these processes run as Docker-containers and use persistent NetApp storage with NetApp Docker volume plugin (NetAppDVP)

Detailed documentation can be found on [Read the Docs](http://netapp-jenkins-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
